I'm a last-year research master's student in Computer Science at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en) and [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) under the supervision of [Reihaneh Rabbany](http://www.reirab.com/). I got my bachelor's in Computer Science from [Sharif University of Technology](https://www.sharif.ir/).

My research focuses on advancing the fields of Temporal Graph Representation Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Machine Learning for Graphs. I have experience working with Deep Learning, Graph Neural Networks, and Recommender Systems. I am particularly passionate about applying these techniques to interdisciplinary areas such as Financial Markets, NLP, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and Network Science.
